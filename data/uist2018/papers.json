    "abstract": "Locomotion,the most basic interaction in Virtual Environments (VE), enables users to move around the virtual world. Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) is a problem which has not been solved completely since existing techniques have a specific set of requirements and limitations. In addition, the uncertainty about the impact that virtual cues have on users perception complicates the development of better locomotion interfaces. A broadly applicable locomotion technique that is easy to use and addresses the issues of presence, cybersickness and fatigue has yet to be developed. Though optical flow and vestibular cues are dominant in navigation, other cues such as auditory, arm feedback, wind, etc. play a role. The proposed research aims to evaluate and improve upon a set of locomotion techniques for different modes of locomotion in virtual scenarios, as well as the transitions between them. The outcome measures of the evaluations of the different scenarios are usefulness for spatial orientation, presence, fatigue, cybersickness and user preference. The envisioned contribution of my thesis is research towards the design of a locomotion technique that is easy to use and addresses the shortcomings of current implementations.",

    "abstract": "People often run into barriers when doing creative tasks with software because it is difficult to translate goals into concrete actions. While expert-made tutorials, examples, and documentation abound online, finding the most relevant content and adapting it to one\u0092s own situation and task is a challenge. My research introduces techniques for exposing relevant examples to novices in the context of their own workflows. These techniques are embodied in three systems. The first, RePlay, helps people find solutions when stuck by automatically locating relevant moments from expert-made videos. The second, DiscoverySpace, helps novices get started by mining and recommending expert-made software macros. The third, CritiqueKit, helps novices improve their work by providing ambient guidance and recommendations. Preliminary experiments with RePlay suggest that contextual video clips help people complete targeted tasks. Controlled experiments with DiscoverySpace and CritiqueKit demonstrate that software macros prevent novices from losing confidence, and ambient guidance improves novice output. My research illustrates the power of user communities to support creative learning.",

People are willing to invest in expensive cameras as a medium for their artistic expression, but few have access to in-person classes. Inspired by critique sessions common in in-person art practice classes, we propose design principles for creative learning. My dissertation research focuses on designing new interfaces and interactions that provide contextual in-camera feedback to aid users in learning visual elements of photography. We interactively visualize results of image processing algorithms as additional information for the user to make more informed and intentional decisions during capture. In this paper, we describe our design principles, and apply these principles in the design of two guided photography interfaces: one to explore lighting options for a portrait, and one to refine contents and composition of a photo.

I believe that shape-changing interfaces will be increasingly available to end-users in the future. To increase acceptance of shape-changing interfaces by end-users, we need to provide designers with design criteria and framework closely grounded on their current skills and needs. Also, we need to provide them with prototyping tools to enable quick assessment of ideas in the physical world. In this paper, I introduce the three threads of my Ph.D. research in the direction of providing the design tools. First, I advance existing shape-changing interface taxonomies to broaden design vocabulary and systemize design framework, based on the classification of everyday objects. Second, I conduct a study with end-users to suggest interaction techniques and design guidelines for shape-changing interfaces from their current practice. Lastly, I develop a physical prototyping tool for shape-changing interfaces to shorten prototyping iterations based on well-known Lego-like bricks.",

    "abstract": "As interactions move beyond the desktop, interactive behaviours (effects of actions as they happen, or once they happen) are becoming increasingly complex. This complexity is due to the variety of forms that objects might take, and the different inputs and sensors capturing information, and the ability to create nuanced responses to those inputs. Current interaction design tools do not support much of this rich behaviour authoring. In my work I create prototyping tools that examine ways in which designers can create interactive behaviours. Thus far, I have created two prototyping tools: Pineal and Astral, which examine how to create physical forms based on a smart object\u0092s behaviour, and how to reuse existing desktop infrastructures to author different kinds of interactive behaviour. I also contribute conceptual elements, such as how to create smart objects using mobile devices, their sensors and outputs, instead of using custom electronic circuits, as well as devising evaluation strategies used in HCI toolkit research which directly informs my approach to evaluating my tools.

These experiences can be classified based on the scale of the interactive area (room vs city/global scale) , or the fidelity of the experience (high vs low). Experiences that target large areas, such as campus or world scale, commonly have only rudimentary interactions with the physical world, and suffer from registration errors and jitter. We classify these experiences as large scale and low fidelity. On the other hand, various room sized experiences feature realistic interaction of virtual content with the real world. We classify these experiences as small scale and high fidelity. Our work is the first to explore the domain of large scale high fidelity (LSHF) AR experiences. We build upon the small scale high fidelity capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens to allow LSHF interactions. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system with a game specifically designed for LSHF interactions, handling many challenges and limitations unique to the domain of LSHF AR through the game design. Our contributions are twofold:  - The lessons learned during the design and development of a system capable of LSHF AR interactions. - Identification of a set of reusable game elements specific to LSHF AR, including mechanisms for addressing spatiotemporal\ninconsistencies and crowd control.

The technological advances in VR give the possibility to design malleable and extensible representations and more natural and engaging interactions.

The results indicate that there is a relationship between the shape of a knob and its haptic feedback.

After further consideration in regard to user comfort, we determined that two levels of force, 2.7 kPa and 3.375 kPa, are ideal for the development of the FacePush experience via implementation with three applications which demonstrate use of discrete and continuous normal force for the actions of boxing, diving, and 360 guidance in virtual reality.

The proposed method enables the user to progressively discover and ideate labels in an exploratory fashion and specify rules that can be used to automatically match sets of documents to labels. To support this process of ideation, specification, as well as evaluation of the labels, we use unsupervised machine learning methods that provide suggestions and data summaries.

A user study of our system demonstrated that our modifications to the game did not hurt enjoyment or increase cognitive load, and that players could successfully apply knowledge and skills learned in the game to tasks in a popular 3D solid modeling application. The process of developing Blocks-to-CAD also revealed eight design strategies that can be applied to design cross-application bridges for other applications and domains.",

    "abstract": "SilentVoice is a new voice input interface device that penetrates the speech-based natural user interface (NUI) in daily life. The proposed \"ingressive speech\" method enables placement of a microphone very close to the front of the mouth without suffering from pop-noise, capturing very soft speech sounds with a good S/N ratio. It realizes ultra-small (less than 39dB(A)) voice leakage, allowing us to use voice input without annoying surrounding people in public and mobile situations as well as offices and homes. By measuring airflow direction, SilentVoice can easily be separated from normal utterances with 98.8% accuracy; no activation words are needed. It can be used for voice-activated systems with a specially trained voice recognizer; evaluation results yield word error rates (WERs) of 1.8% (speaker-dependent condition), and 7.0% (speaker-independent condition) with a limited dictionary of 85 command sentences. A whisper-like natural voice can also be used for real-time voice communication.",

Users interact with DualPanto by operating the me handle with one hand and by holding on to the it handle with the other hand. Each handle is connected to a pantograph haptic input/output device. The key feature is that the two handles are spatially registered with respect to each other. When guiding their avatar through a virtual world using the me handle, spatial registration enables users to track moving objects by having the device guide the output hand. This allows blind players of a 1-on-1 soccer game to race for the ball or evade an opponent; it allows blind players of a shooter game to aim at an opponent and dodge shots. In our user study, blind participants reported very high enjoyment when using the device to play (6.5/7).",

However, conventional methods involve selecting a single modality based on which will work best with the task the user is most likely to perform and using this modality throughout the duration of the navigation. In this paper, we describe the design and results of a study intended to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive modality selection algorithm that dynamically selects a navigation system's directional guidance modality while considering both task-specific benefits and the time-varying effects of switching cost, stimulus-specific adaptation, and habituation.

When participants used Play Write while simultaneously watching a video, we found that they strongly preferred its microtask-based editing approach to the traditional editing experience offered by Mobile Word.

Creating automatic tools is challenging due to ambiguities in object segmentation, relative depth ordering, and non-existent temporal information. With a few user drawn scribbles as input, our mixed initiative creative interface extracts repetitive texture elements in an image, and supports animating them. Our system also facilitates the creation of multiple layers to enhance depth cues in the animation. Finally, after analyzing the artwork during segmentation, several animation processes automatically generate kinetic textures that are spatio-temporally coherent with the source image. Our results, as well as feedback from our user evaluation, suggest that our system effectively allows illustrators and animators to add life to still images in a broad range of visual styles.",

To represent the haptic sensations of magnetic force intuitively, magneto-haptics formularizes haptic potential from the distribution of magnetic force along the path of motion. It provides a rapid way to compute the relationship between the magnetic phenomena and the haptic mechanism.

Each conventional ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RFID tag is modified by connecting its antenna and chip to a reed switch and then attaching a magnet to one of the reed switch's terminals, thus transforming it into an always-on switch. When the two modules approach each other, the magnets counteract each other and turn off both switches at the same time. The coabsence of IDs thus indicates a unique interaction event. In addition to sensing, the module also provides native haptic feedback through magnetic repulsion force, enabling users to perceive the system's state eyes-free, without physical constraints. Additional visual feedback can be provided through an energy-harvesting module and a light emitting diode.

One class of these techniques is Body Channel Communication (BCC), a method that overlays physical touch with digital information. Despite the number of published capacitive sensing and communication prototypes, there exists no guideline on how to design such hardware or what are the application limitations and possibilities. Specifically, wearable (groundless) BCC has been proven in the past to be extremely challenging to implement. Additionally, the exact behavior of the human body as an EM-field medium is still not fully understood today. Consequently, the application domain of BCC technology could not be fully explored.\n\nThis paper addresses this problem. Based on a recently published general purpose wearable BCC system, we first present a thorough evaluation of the impact of various technical parameter choices and an exhaustive channel characterization of the human body as a host for BCC. Second, we discuss the implications of these results for the application design space and present guidelines for future wearable BCC systems and their applications. Third, we point out an important observation of the measurements, namely that BCC can employ the whole body as user interface (and not just hands or feet). We sketch several applications with these novel interaction modalities.",

Current aviation weather products are unable to provide a holistic and intuitive view of the overall weather situation, especially in terms of turbulence forecasts. This work introduces an interactive 3D prototype developed with a user-centered design approach. The prototype focuses on the visualization of significant weather charts, which are utilized during flight preparation. An online user study is conducted to compare the prototype with today's 2D paper maps. A total of 64 pilots from an internationally operating airline participated in the study. Among the major findings of the study is that the prototype significantly decreased the cognitive load, and enhanced spatial awareness and usability. To determine the spatial awareness, a novel similarity measure for spatial configurations of aviation weather data is introduced.",

When a user moves the controller on a virtual surface, we add a slip opposite to the movement, creating an illusion of a finger that is sliding on the surface, while varying the slip feedback changes lateral forces on fingertip. When coupled with hand motion the lateral forces can be used to create perceptions of artificial textures. RollingStone has been implemented as a prototype VR controller consisting of a ball-based slip display positioned under the user\u0092s fingertip. Within the slip display, a pair of motors actuates the ball, which is capable of gener- ating both short- and long-term two-degree-of-freedom slip feedback. An exploratory study was conducted to ensure that changing the relative motion between the finger and the ball could alter the perceptions conveying the properties of a tex- ture. The following two perception-based studies examined the minimum changes in speed of slip and angle of slip that are detectable by users. The results help us to design haptic patterns as well as our prototype applications. Finally, our preliminary user evaluation indicated that participants wel- comed RollingStone as a useful addition to the range of VR controllers.",

    "abstract": "The sensation of being able to feel the shape of an object when grasping it in Virtual Reality (VR) enhances a sense of presence and the ease of object manipulation. Though most prior works focus on force feedback on fingers, the haptic emulation of grasping a 3D shape requires the sensation of touch using the entire hand. Hence, we present Pop-up Prop on Palm (PuPoP), a light-weight pneumatic shape-proxy interface worn on the palm that pops several airbags up with predefined primitive shapes for grasping. When a user's hand encounters a virtual object, an airbag of appropriate shape, ready for grasping, is inflated by way of the use of air pumps; the airbag then deflates when the object is no longer in play. Since PuPoP is a physical prop, it can provide the full sensation of touch to enhance the sense of realism for VR object manipulation. For this paper, we first explored the design and implementation of PuPoP with multiple shape structures. We then conducted two user studies to further understand its applicability. The first study shows that, when in conflict, visual sensation tends to dominate over touch sensation, allowing a prop with a fixed size to represent multiple virtual objects with similar sizes. The second study compares PuPoP with controllers and free-hand manipulation in two VR applications. The results suggest that utilization of dynamically-changing PuPoP, when grasped by users in line with the shapes of virtual objects, enhances enjoyment and realism. We believe that PuPoP is a simple yet effective way to convey haptic shapes in VR.",

ShareSpace works by allowing external users to place \u0093shields\u0094 in the virtual environment by using a set of physical shield tools. A pad visualizer helps this process by allowing external users to examine the arrangement of virtual shields.

To evaluate our design, a user study was conducted to collect user feedback from participants in four trial scenarios. The results indicate that our ShareSpace system allows users to perform their respective activities with improved engagement and safety. In addition, this study shows that while the HMD users did perceive a considerable degree of interference due to the internal visual indications from the ShareSpace system, they were still more engaged in their VR experience than when interrupted by direct external physical interference initiated by external users.\n",

To lower these development barriers, we introduce a technique that enables people to prototype opportunistically by borrowing pieces of desired functionality from across the web without needing any access to their underlying codebases, build environments, or server backends. We implemented this technique in a browser extension called Fusion, which lets users create web UI mashups by extracting components from existing unmodified webpages and hooking them together using transclusion and JavaScript glue code. We demonstrate the generality and versatility of Fusion via a case study where we used it to create seven UI mashups in domains such as programming tools, data science, web design, and collaborative work. Our mashups include replicating portions of prior HCI systems (Blueprint for in-situ code search and DS.js for in-browser data science), extending the p5.js IDE for Processing with real-time collaborative editing, and integrating Python Tutor code visualizations into static tutorials.

Novice users can learn the mappings through dynamic visual guidance revealed by holding a key down, but experts can trigger shortcuts directly without pausing. Two variations are described: FingerArc uses the angle of the thumb, and FingerChord uses a second key press. The techniques are motivated by an interview study identifying factors hindering the learning, use, and exploration of keyboard shortcuts.

This paper presents WiFr\u00f6st , a new approach for debugging these systems using instrumentation that spans from the device itself, to its communication API, to the wireless router and back-end server. WiFr\u00f6st automatically collects this data, displays it in a web-based visualization, and highlights likely issues with an extensible suite of checks based on analysis of recorded execution traces.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Touch+Finger, a new interaction technique that augments touch input with multi-finger gestures for rich and expressive interaction. The main idea is that while one finger is engaged in a touch event, a user can leverage the remaining fingers, the \u0093idle\u0094 fingers, to perform a variety of hand poses or in-air gestures to extend touch-based user interface capabilities. To fully understand the use of these idle fingers, we constructed a design space based on conventional touch gestures (i.e., single- and multi-touch gestures) and inter- action period (i.e., before and during touch). Considering the design space, we investigated the possible movement of the idle fingers and developed a total of 20 Touch+Finger gestures. Using ring-like devices to track the motion of the idle fingers in the air, we evaluated the Touch+Finger gestures on both recognition accuracy and ease of use. They were classified with a recognition accuracy of over 99% and received positive and negative comments from 8 participants. We suggested 8 interaction techniques with Touch+Finger gestures that demonstrate extended touch-based user interface capabilities.",

Hand-to-face gestures have been proposed as a way to add input expressivity while keeping control movements unobtrusive. To better understand how to design such techniques, we describe an elicitation study conducted in a busy public space in which pairs of users were asked to generate unobtrusive, socially acceptable hand-to-face input actions. Based on the results, we describe five design strategies: miniaturizing, obfuscating, screening, camouflaging and re-purposing. We instantiate these strategies in two hand-to-face input prototypes, one based on touches to the ear and the other based on touches of the thumbnail to the chin or cheek. Performance assessments characterize time and error rates with these devices. The paper closes with a validation study in which pairs of users experience the prototypes in a public setting and we gather data on the social acceptability of the designs and reflect on the effectiveness of the different strategies.",

However, recreating the haptic experience for hand tools in VR traditionally requires hardware with precise actuators, adding complexity to the system.  We propose Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting, an interaction technique that provides a realistic haptic experience for grabbing tools using only passive mechanisms.  This technique leverages the ungrounded feedback inherent in grabbing tools combined with dynamic visual adjustments of their position in virtual reality to create an illusion of physical presence for virtual objects.  To demonstrate the capabilities of this technique, we created VR Grabbers, an exemplary passive VR controller, similar to training chopsticks, with haptic feedback for precise object selection and manipulation. \n\nWe conducted two user studies based on VR Grabbers.  The first study probed the perceptual limits of the illusion; we found that the maximum position difference between the virtual and physical world acceptable to the user is (-1.48, 1.95) cm.  The second study showed that task performance of the VR Grabbers controller with Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting enabled outperforms the same controller with Ungrounded Haptic Retargeting disabled. \n",

Prior studies have examined the use of kinematic variables of collision between objects, such as position, velocity, force, and impact. However, the nature of the collision can be understood more thoroughly by considering the known physical relationships that exist between directly measurable variables (i.e., kinetics). Based on this collision kinetics, this study proposes a novel touch technique called FDSense. By simultaneously observing the force and contact area measured from the touchpad, FDSense allows estimation of the Young\u0092s modulus and stiffness of the object being contacted. Our technical evaluation showed that FDSense could effectively estimate the Young\u0092s modulus of end effectors made of various materials, and the stiffness of each part of the human hand. Two applications using FDSense were demonstrated, for digital painting and digital instruments, where the result of the expression varies significantly depending on the elasticity of the end effector.

We describe a new prediction algorithm for direct touch devices based on (i) a state-of-the-art finite-time derivative estimator, (ii) a smoothing mechanism based on input speed, and (iii) a post-filtering of the prediction in two steps. Using both a pre-existing dataset of touch input as benchmark, and subjective data from a new user study, we show that this new predictor outperforms the predictors currently available in the literature and industry, based on metrics that model user-defined negative side-effects caused by input prediction.

    "abstract": "Many web pages developed today require navigation by visual interaction\u0097seeing,  hovering, pointing,  clicking, and dragging with the mouse over dynamic page content.  These forms of interaction are increasingly popular as developer trends have moved from static, logically structured pages to dynamic, interactive pages. However, they are also often inaccessible to blind web users who tend to rely on keyboard-based  screen  readers  to  navigate  the  web. Despite  existing web accessibility standards, engineering web pages to be equally accessible via both keyboard and visuomotor mouse-based interactions is often not a priority for developers. Improving access to this kind of visual and interactive web content has been a long-standing  goal of HCI researchers, but the barriers have proven to be too varied and unpredictable to be overcome by some of the proposed solutions: promoting  guidelines and  best  practices,  automatically  generating accessible versions of pre-exisiting web pages, or developing human-assisted solutions, such as screen and cursor-sharing, which  tend  to  diminish  an  end  user\u0092s  agency. In this paper we present a real-time, collaborative approach to helping blind web users overcome inaccessible parts of existing web pages.  We introduce *Arboretum*, a new architecture that enables  any  web user to seamlessly hand off controlled parts of their browsing session to remote users, while maintaining control over the interface via a \"propose and accept/reject\" mechanism. We  illustrate  the  benefit of Arboretum by using it to implement *Arbility*, a browser that allows blind users to hand off targeted visual interaction tasks to remote crowd workers. We  evaluate the entire system in a study  with 9 blind web users, showing that Arbility allows them to interact with web content that was previously difficult to access via a screen reader alone.",

Using this simple technique, it is possible to create unsupported structures that can be translated and oriented freely in 3D. Shape transformations can also be recorded to allow for simple physical shape morphing animations. This work extends previous work on selection and editing techniques for 3D user interfaces. ",

    "abstract": "Fact-checking, the task of assessing the veracity of claims, is an important, timely, and challenging problem. While many automated fact-checking systems have been recently proposed, the human side of the partnership has been largely neglected: how might people understand, interact with, and establish trust with an AI fact-checking system? Does such a system actually help people better assess the factuality of claims? In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative approach to fact-checking, blending human knowledge and experience with the efficiency and scalability of automated information retrieval and ML. In a user study in which participants used our system to aid their own assessment of claims, our results suggest that individuals tend to trust the system: participant accuracy assessing claims improved when exposed to correct model predictions. However, this trust perhaps goes too far: when the model was wrong, exposure to its predictions often degraded human accuracy. Participants given the option to interact with these incorrect predictions were often able improve their own performance. This suggests that transparent models are key to facilitating effective human interaction with fallible AI models.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Dynamic 3D Printing, a fast and reconstructable shape formation system. Dynamic 3D Printing can assemble an arbitrary three-dimensional shape from a large number of small physical elements. Also, it can disassemble the shape back to elements and reconstruct a new shape. Dynamic 3D Printing combines the capabilities of 3D printers and shape displays: Like conventional 3D printing, it can generate arbitrary and graspable three-dimensional shapes, while allowing shapes to be rapidly formed and reformed as in a shape display. To demonstrate the idea, we describe the design and implementation of Dynablock, a working prototype of a dynamic 3D printer. Dynablock can form a three-dimensional shape in seconds by assembling 3,000 9 mm blocks, leveraging a 24 x 16 pin-based shape display as a parallel assembler. Dynamic 3D printing is a step toward achieving our long-term vision in which 3D printing becomes an interactive medium, rather than the means for fabrication that it is today. In this paper, we explore possibilities for this vision by illustrating application scenarios that are difficult to achieve with conventional 3D printing or shape display systems.",

However, many settings, such as those in education or the workplace, benefit from sharing this autonomy between the user and the system, and thus from a system that adapts to them over time. In this paper, we pursue two primary research questions: (1) How do we design interfaces to share autonomy between the user and the system? (2) How does shared autonomy alter a user\"s perception of a system? We present SharedKeys, an interactive shared autonomy system for piano instruction that plays different video segments of a piece for students to emulate and practice. Underlying our approach to shared autonomy is a mixed-observability Markov decision process that estimates a user\"s desired autonomy level based on her performance and attentiveness.

One of the causes is the annotation process used to label training images. In most image categorization tasks, there is a fundamental ambiguity between some image categories and the underlying class probability differs from very obvious cases to ambiguous ones. However, current machine learning systems and applications usually work with discrete annotation processes and the training labels do not reflect this ambiguity. To address this issue, we propose an new image annotation framework where labeling incorporates human gaze behavior. In this framework, gaze behavior is used to predict image labeling difficulty. The image classifier is then trained with sample weights defined by the predicted difficulty. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on four-class image classification tasks.",

Theses biases can be informed by a multitude of non-verbal cues such as voice pitch and voice volume. This project explores how haptic effects, generated from speech, could attenuate listeners' perceived voice-related biases formed from a speaker's voice pitch. Promising preliminary results collected during a decision-making task suggest that the speech to haptic mapping and vibration delivery mechanism employed does attenuate voice-related biases. Accordingly, it is anticipated that such a system could be introduced in the workplace to equalize people's contribution opportunities and to create a more inclusive environment by reversing voice-related biases.",

This uniform interaction with all surrounding sounds can have a negative impact on social relations and situational awareness. Leveraging mediation through smarter headphones, users gain more agency over their sense of hearing: For instance by being able to selectively alter the volume and other features of specific sounds, without losing the ability to add media.  In this work, we propose the vision of interactive auditory mediated reality (AMR). To understand users' attitude and requirements, we conducted a week-long event sampling study (n = 12), where users recorded and rated sources (n = 225) which they would like to mute, amplify or turn down. The results indicate that besides muting, a distinct, \"quiet-but-audible\" volume exists. It caters to two requirements at the same time: aesthetics/comfort and information acquisition.",

We found that using the bistable image called the Necker's cube as a button user interface (UI) helps to remedy the limitation. When users switch two rivaling percepts of the Necker's cube at will, unique eye movements are triggered and these characteristics can be used to indicate a button press or a selecting action. In this paper, we introduce (1) the cognitive phenomenon called \"percept switch\" for gaze interaction, and (2) propose \"perceptual switch\" or the Necker's cube user interface (UI) which uses \"percept switch\" as the indication of a selection. Our preliminary experiment confirms that perceptual switch can be used to distinguish voluntary gaze selection from random navigation, and discusses that the visual elements of the Necker's cube such as size and biased visual cues could be adjusted for the optimal use of individual users.",

    "abstract": "In order to design serious games, attention needs to be paid to the target users. One important application of serious games is the design of games for older adults with dementia. Interfaces and activities in games designed for this group of users should be conducted by considering both the cognitive and physical limitations of these people, which may be challenging. We overcome these challenges by using the advantages of new head mounted display virtual reality (HMD-VR) technology and the knowledge of experts. The results of a preliminary three-week exercise involving participants with dementia shows that our design approach has been successful in achieving an interesting environment and could engage participants in the game.",

    "abstract": "Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research in public spaces often encounters delays and restrictions due to several factors, including the need for sophisticated technology, regulatory approvals, and public or community support. To remedy these concerns, we suggest HRI can apply the core philosophy of Tactical Urbanism, a concept from urban planning, to catalyze HRI in public spaces, provide community feedback and information on the feasibility of future implementations of robots in the public, and also create social impact and forge connections with the community while spreading awareness about robots as a public resource. As a case study, we share tactics used and strategies followed to conduct a pop-up style study of 'A robotic mailbox to support and raise awareness about homelessness.' We discuss benefits and challenges of the pop-up approach and recommend using it to enable the social studies of HRI not only to match but to precede, the fast-paced technological advancement and deployment of robots.",
